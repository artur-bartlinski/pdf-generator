# pdf-generator

This is a very simple PDF file generator. Basically, it creates PDF file from HTML file, which is static at the moment,
but one may extend functionality by adding an editor and creating PDF from editor's content written by user.

In this simple script I have used HTML, Bootstrap CSS, PHP, JavaScript(Phantom JS library), Twig and some 
Symfony 3 framework components(Http Foundation, Process).
